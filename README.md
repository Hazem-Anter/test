Notes 📝

- src/app/core/services/data.ts is the main application service (providedIn: 'root').
- app.config.ts centralizes providers (router, HTTP, firebase, auth) and should be passed to bootstrapApplication() in main.ts.
- Feature folders follow a component-per-folder pattern: component.ts, component.html, component.css.

# 🔐 Authentication

- Register and log in users using local storage as mock persistence.  
- Supports role-based access (Admin and User).  
- Maintains login state using Angular signals.  
- Includes logout and session validation functionality.  
- Automatically assigns admin privileges to predefined admin accounts.

---

# 🌐 Social Login

## 🔵 Google Login
- Uses Google Identity Services for authentication.  
- Retrieves and decodes user information (name, email, profile picture).  
- Automatically registers or updates the user in the local data store.

## 🔷 Facebook Login
- Integrates the Facebook SDK for secure authentication.  
- Requests access to basic profile and email information.  
- Saves or updates user data locally for seamless future access.

## 🔁 Shared Features
- Unified logic for saving, updating, and managing social user sessions.  
- Automatic session restoration on reload.  
- Secure logout for both Google and Facebook sessions.

---

# 🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard

A standalone component displaying mock data and key statistics for administrators.

- Displays registered users and order lists.  
- Shows total users, total orders, and pending orders.  
- Provides a quick overview of platform activity.  
- Demonstrates how role-based access can control admin views.

---

# 🔥 Firebase Integration

This project includes optional Firebase setup instructions for integrating a real backend.

- Authentication  
- Firestore Database  
- Cloud Storage  
- Hosting for deployment  

---

# 🔗 API Integration

This project uses the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) 🌍 to simulate backend data for products, carts, and user authentication.

Base URL 🌐  

All requests use the public API:  

bash  
    https://dummyjson.com/  

Implementation ⚙  
HTTP communication is handled through Angular’s HttpClient within the data.service.ts file located in:  

bash  
src/app/core/services/data.ts  

Example usage: 💡  

bash  
 private apiUrl = 'https://dummyjson.com/products';

 getProducts(): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.get(${this.apiUrl}?limit=100);
  }

Common EndPoints 🔗  

| Feature | Endpoint | Method | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Get all products | /products | GET | Retrieve all products |
| Get single product | /products/{id} | GET | Retrieve details of a specific product |
| Search products | /products/search?q={query} | GET | Search by keyword |
| Get categories | /products/categories | GET | Retrieve all product categories |
| Get products by category | /products/category/{category} | GET | Retrieve products in a given category |

### 🗒️ Notes:
- No backend setup is required.  
- All data is fetched directly from DummyJSON.  
- You can replace DummyJSON later with a real backend by updating the API URLs in `data.ts`.

## 🪄 Future Improvements

1. Real API Integration – Replace DummyJSON with a live backend (.NET + SQL). ⚙  
2. Authentication & Authorization – Implement JWT-based login, signup, and role management (admin/user). 🔑  
3. Recommendations – Smart suggestions based on user activity. 🧠  
4. Unit & Integration Testing. 🧪
